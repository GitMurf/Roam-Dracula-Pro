# Instructions for Installation

Copy [this code](http://abhayprasanna.github.io/dark-age-dracula.css) and paste it into a css code block in your [[roam/css]].
Feel free to customize the fonts, colors, etc. and add any other code you like below this as needed.

This works by linking to an outside .css file, actually located [here](https://abhayprasanna.github.io/better-dark-age.css) to handle all the styling, as it keeps the roam/css page much cleaner/faster.

If you do in fact want to manipulate the source code, just [navigate to the source .css file](https://abhayprasanna.github.io/better-dark-age.css) manually, copy it, and paste it all into your roam/css page.

I highly recommend installing the following Javascript extensions (the theme is designed to work in conjunction with them):
* [Roam42](http://roam42.com/)
* [Shodty's Right side bar button JS](https://gist.github.com/shodty/e4f718108b401a830b272da62ba6cfc3)
* [Dharam's Back/Forward JS](https://gist.github.com/dkapila/2155820441d19708948767d4bf85a444)

Here are some [optional CSS](https://github.com/abhayprasanna/abhayprasanna.github.io/blob/master/optional.css) additions and tweaks you can play with.
If youd' like to include *rainbow indents* please add [this CSS snippet](https://github.com/abhayprasanna/abhayprasanna.github.io/blob/master/rainbow-indent.css).
